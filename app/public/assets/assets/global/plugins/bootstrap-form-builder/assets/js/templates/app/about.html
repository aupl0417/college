<h3>About</h3>

<p>
Inspired By Adam Moore (@<a href="http://twitter.com/minikomi">minikomi</a>) to help take the stress out of 
writing all that markup to get bootstrap forms together. The original version of this was a big jQuery
spaghetti mess, so as of March 2013 it has been rewritten using <a href="backbonejs.org">backbone.js</a> and 
takes advantage of <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">underscode.js templates</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is the BootStrap 3 version. Rewritter the previous version using in-house Class implementation,
and <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> template language. Did not pick backbone.js because I already
know it and want to learn and implment MVC Javascript framework by my own. This is also another learning/hacking
experience for me.
</p>

<p>
  Adding snippets is quite simple now (due to the rewrite!) so please don't hesitate to open an issue!
